--- abstract


This specification defines Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE) for use with
JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE). HPKE offers a variant of
public key encryption of arbitrary-sized plaintexts for a recipient public key.

HPKE works for any combination of an asymmetric key encapsulation mechanism (KEM),
key derivation function (KDF), and authenticated encryption with additional data
(AEAD) function. Authentication for HPKE in JOSE is provided by
JOSE-native security mechanisms or by one of the authenticated variants of HPKE.

This document defines the use of the HPKE with JOSE.

# Introduction

Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE) {{RFC9180}} is a scheme that
provides public key encryption of arbitrary-sized plaintexts given a
recipient's public key.

This specification enables JSON Web Encryption (JWE) to leverage HPKE,
bringing support for KEMs and the possibility of Post Quantum or Hybrid KEMs to JWE.

# Conventions and Definitions

# Conventions and Terminology

This specification uses the following abbreviations and terms:

- Content Encryption Key (CEK), is defined in {{RFC7517}}.
- Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE) is defined in {{RFC9180}}.
- pkR is the public key of the recipient, as defined in {{RFC9180}}.
- skR is the private key of the recipient, as defined in {{RFC9180}}.
- Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM), see {{RFC9180}}.
- Key Derivation Function (KDF), see {{RFC9180}}.
- Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD), see {{RFC9180}}.
- Additional Authenticated Data (AAD), see {{RFC9180}}.

# Overview

This specification describes two modes of use for HPKE in JWE:

  *  HPKE JWE Integrated Encryption, where HPKE is used to encrypt the plaintext.
  *  HPKE JWE Key Encryption, where HPKE is used to encrypt a content encryption key (CEK) and the CEK is subsequently used to encrypt the plaintext.

When "alg" is a JOSE-HPKE algorithm:

  * If "enc" is "dir", HPKE JWE Integrated Encryption is used.
  * If "enc" is an AEAD algorithm, the recipient Key Managment mode is Key Encryption.

The HPKE KEM, KDF, and AEAD used depend on the JOSE-HPKE algorithm used.

HPKE supports several modes, which are described in Table 1 of {{RFC9180}}.

In JWE, the use of specific HPKE modes such as "mode_base" or "mode_auth_psk" is determined by the presence of the header parameters "psk_id" and "auth_kid".

JWE supports different serializations, including Compact JWE Serialization as described in Section 3.1 of {{RFC7516}}, General JWE JSON Serialization as described in Section 3.2 of {{RFC7516}}.

Certain JWE features are only supported in specific serializations.

For example Compact JWE Serialization does not support the following:

- additional authenticated data
- multiple recipients
- unprotected headers

HPKE JWE Key Encryption can be used with "aad" but only when not expressed with Compact JWE Serialization.

Single recipient HPKE JWE Key Encryption with no "aad" can be expressed in Compact JWE Serialization, so long as the recipient and sender use the same HPKE Setup process as described in { Section 5 of RFC9180 }.

## Auxiliary Authenticated Application Information

HPKE has two places at which applications can specify auxiliary authenticated information as described in { Section 8.1 of RFC9180 }.

HPKE algorithms are not required to process "apu" and "apv" as described in Section 4.6.1 of {{RFC7518}}, despite appearing to be similar to key agreement algorithms (such as "ECDH-ES").

The "aad parameter" for Open() and Seal() MUST be used with both HPKE JWE Integrated Encryption and HPKE JWE Key Encryption.

To avoid confusion between JWE AAD and HPKE AAD, this document uses the term "HPKE AEAD AAD" to refer the "aad parameter" for Open() and Seal().

## Encapsulated Keys

Encapsulated keys MUST be the base64url encoded encapsulated key as defined in Section 5.1.1 of {{RFC9180}}.

In HPKE JWE Integrated Encryption, JWE Encrypted Key is the encapsulated key.

In HPKE JWE Key Encryption, each recipient JWE Encrypted Key is the encrypted content encryption key, and the encapsulated key (ek) is found in the recipient header.

# Integrated Encryption

In HPKE JWE Integrated Encryption:

- The protected header MUST contain an "alg" that starts with "HPKE".
- The protected header MUST contain an "enc" and it MUST be set to the value "dir". It updates Section 4.1.2 of {{RFC7516}} to clarify that in case where HPKE JWE Integrated Encryption is used, setting "enc" set to "dir" is appropriate, as both the derivation of the CEK and the encryption of the plaintext are fully handled within the HPKE encryption.
- The protected header parameters "psk_id" and "auth_kid" MAY be present.
- The protected header parameter "ek" MUST NOT be present.
- The "encrypted_key" MUST be the base64url encoded encapsulated key as defined in Section 5.1.1 of {{RFC9180}}.
- The "iv", "tag" and "aad" members MUST NOT be present.
- The "ciphertext" MUST be the base64url encoded ciphertext as defined in Section 5.2 of {{RFC9180}}.
- The HPKE Setup info parameter MUST be set to an empty string.
- The HPKE AEAD AAD MUST be set to the "JWE Additional Authenticated Data encryption parameter", as defined in Step 14 of Section 5.1 of {{RFC7516}}.

Note that compression is possible with integrated encryption, see Section 4.1.3 of {{RFC7516}}.

When decrypting, the checks in {{RFC7516}} section 5.2, steps 1 through 5 MUST be performed. The JWE Encrypted Key in step 2 is the
base64url encoded encapsulated key.

# Key Encryption

HPKE based recipients can be added alongside existing `ECDH-ES+A128KW` or `RSA-OAEP-384` recipients because HPKE is only used to encrypt the content encryption key, and because the protected header used in content encryption is passed to HPKE as Additional Authenticated Data.

In HPKE JWE Key Encryption:

- The protected header MUST NOT contain an "alg".
- The protected header MUST contain an "enc" that is registered in both the IANA HPKE AEAD Identifiers Registry, and the IANA JSON Web Signature and Encryption Algorithms Registry.
- The recipient unprotected header parameters "psk_id" and "auth_kid" MAY be present.
- The recipient unprotected header parameter "ek" MUST be present.
- The recipient unprotected header MUST contain a registered HPKE "alg" value.
- The "encrypted_key" MUST be the base64url encoded content encryption key as described in Step 15 in Section 5.1 of {{RFC7516}}.
- The recipient "encrypted_key" is as described in Section 7.2.1 of {{RFC7516}}.
- The "iv", "tag" JWE members MUST be present.
- The "aad" JWE member MAY be present.
- The "ciphertext" MUST be the base64url encoded ciphertext as described in Step 19 in Section 5.1 of {{RFC7516}}.
- The HPKE Setup info parameter MUST be set to an empty string.

# Security Considerations

This specification is based on HPKE and the security considerations of
{{RFC9180}} are therefore applicable also to this specification.

HPKE assumes the sender is in possession of the public key of the recipient and
HPKE JOSE makes the same assumptions. Hence, some form of public key distribution
mechanism is assumed to exist but outside the scope of this document.

HPKE in Base mode does not offer authentication as part of the HPKE KEM.
In this case JOSE constructs like JWS and JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) can be used to add authentication.
HPKE also offers modes that offer authentication.

HPKE relies on a source of randomness to be available on the device.
In Key Agreement with Key Wrapping mode, CEK has to be randomly generated and it MUST be ensured that the guidelines in {{RFC8937}} for random number generations are followed.

## Authentication using an Asymmetric Key

Implementers are cautioned to note that the use of authenticated KEMs has different meaning when considering integrated encryption and key encryption.
In integrated encryption the KEM operations secure the message plaintext, whereas with key encryption, the KEM operations secure the content encryption key.
For this reason, the use of authenticated KEMs with key encryption is NOT RECOMMENDED, as it gives a false sense of security.
See RFC9180 Section 5.1.3 for details authentication using asymmetric keys.

## Key Management

A single KEM key MUST NOT be used with multiple algorithms.  Each key and its
associated algorithm suite, comprising the KEM, KDF, and AEAD, should be managed independently.  This separation prevents unintended
interactions or vulnerabilities between suites, ensuring the integrity and security guarantees of each algorithm suite are
preserved.  Additionally, the same key MUST NOT be used for both key encryption and integrated encryption, as it may introduce security risks.
It creates algorithm confusion, increases the potential for key leakage, cross-suite attacks, and improper handling of the key.

A single recipient or sender key MUST NOT be used with both JOSE-HPKE and other algorithms as this might enable cross-protocol attacks.

## Plaintext Compression

Implementers are advised to review Section 3.6 of {{RFC8725}}, which states:
Compression of data SHOULD NOT be done before encryption, because such compressed data often reveals information about the plaintext.

## Header Parameters

Implementers are advised to review Section 3.10 of {{RFC8725}}, which comments on application processing of JWE Protected Headers.
Additionally, Unprotected Headers can contain similar information which an attacker could leverage to mount denial of service, forgery or injection attacks.

## Ensure Cryptographic Keys Have Sufficient Entropy

Implementers are advised to review Section 3.5 of {{RFC8725}}, which provides comments on entropy requirements for keys.
This guidance is relevant to both public and private keys used in both Key Encryption and Integrated Encryption.
Additionally, this guidance is applicable to content encryption keys used in Key Encryption mode.

## Validate Cryptographic Inputs

Implementers are advised to review Section 3.4 of {{RFC8725}}, which provides comments on the validation of cryptographic inputs.
This guidance is relevant to both public and private keys used in both Key Encryption and Integrated Encryption, specifically focusing on the structure of the public and private keys.
These inputs are crucial for the HPKE KEM operations.

## Use Appropriate Algorithms

Implementers are advised to review Section 3.2 of {{RFC8725}}, which comments on the selection of appropriate algorithms.
This is guidance is relevant to both Key Encryption and Integrated Encryption.
When using Key Encryption, the strength of the content encryption algorithm should not be significantly different from the strengh of the Key Encryption algorithms used.

#  IANA Considerations {#IANA}

This document adds entries to {{JOSE-IANA}}.

## Ciphersuite Registration

This specification registers a number of ciphersuites for use with HPKE.
A ciphersuite is a group of algorithms, often sharing component algorithms such as hash functions, targeting a security level.
A JOSE-HPKE algorithm, is composed of the following choices:

- HPKE Mode
- KEM Algorithm
- KDF Algorithm
- AEAD Algorithm

The "KEM", "KDF", and "AEAD" values are chosen from the HPKE IANA registry {{HPKE-IANA}}.

The "HPKE Mode" is described in Table 1 of {{RFC9180}}:

- "Base" refers to "mode_base" described in Section 5.1.1 of {{RFC9180}},
which only enables encryption to the holder of a given KEM private key.
- "PSK" refers to "mode_psk", described in Section 5.1.2 of {{RFC9180}},
which authenticates using a pre-shared key.
- "Auth" refers to "mode_auth", described in Section 5.1.3 of {{RFC9180}},
which authenticates using an asymmetric key.
- "Auth_Psk" refers to "mode_auth_psk", described in Section 5.1.4 of {{RFC9180}},
which authenticates using both a PSK and an asymmetric key.

Implementations detect the use of modes by inspecting header parameters.
